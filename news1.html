            <h1>PROOF POINTS: Putting praise to the test</h1>
            <div class="left">
                <p>&emsp;Praising students for good behavior is central to many strategies for helping 
                    teachers deal with unruly students. Scolding students isn’t. But does this nice-guy 
                    approach really work with kids who are testing boundaries, especially rambunctious 
                    adolescents?  One widely used program called CHAMPS was recently tested in a study 
                    involving more than 100 teachers and almost 1,500 middle-school students in a randomized 
                    controlled trial — the kind of gold-standard experiment that is common in medicine but not 
                    in education. The experiment took place in two St. Louis school districts with a majority 
                    of Black and low-income students.<br><br>
                <img src="image/news 1.jpg"> 
                Teachers were coached to say three to five statements of praise for every reprimand and encouraged 
                to raise their “praise rates,” which were monitored. Suddenly, lots of normal behavior 
                became worthy of praise, even “Thank you for raising your hand” and “Thank you for 
                sitting quietly.” <br/><br/>

                Outside observers, who weren’t told which teachers got the training, noted that students 
                were spending more time on task. More importantly, the program appeared to make an academic 
                difference. Math and reading scores on one standardized test were slightly higher in the 
                classrooms of teachers who got the training compared with classrooms that didn’t.<br/><br/> 
                
                “As educators, we often focus on communicating what we don’t want our students to be doing 
                in class, but we have found that just doesn’t work,” said Keith Herman, a professor in the 
                University of Missouri College of Education who was one of the researchers in the study, 
                in a press release. “Instead, we need to be setting clear expectations of what behaviors 
                we do want to be seeing.”<br/><br/>
                
                
                Herman’s middle school study was first posted online in 2020 by the Journal of Educational 
                Psychology and is slated for publication later in 2021. Herman’s earlier 2018 study of a 
                praise-heavy classroom management program for elementary school students called The 
                Incredible Years also found positive results. <br/><br/>
                
                There’s been considerable hand-wringing in America about how to praise children. In the 
                1980s and 1990s, parents were encouraged to lavish praise to raise self-esteem. Then 
                psychologists told us we’d gone too far and had raised a generation of praise-addicted 
                children who lacked internal motivation. Carol Dweck, the Stanford University 
                psychologist, told us it was harmful to praise a child for being smart because that 
                praise makes the child less resilient when faced with a difficult challenge.<br/><br/>

            <h1>About this Specialization</h1>
            <p> &emsp;Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Java—one of the most in-demand 
                programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system. Designed for beginners, this Specialization will 
                teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the 
                foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.</p>

            <h1>Applied Learning Project</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Centered around projects, this Specialization will help you create a portfolio of work to demonstrate your new programming 
                skills. In the capstone you will create a recommender engine similar to those used by Netflix or Amazon. Additional projects in 
                your portfolio will include:an interactive webpage that applies filters to images, an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption 
                program, and a predictive text generator.</p>

            <h1>Take Courses</h1>
            <p> &emsp;A Tech Mentor Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, 
                or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, 
                you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or 
                end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>

        <div class="info">
            <h1>Hands-on Project</h1>
            <p> &emsp;Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization 
                and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of 
                the other courses before you can start it.</p>

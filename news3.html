            <div class="left">
                <p>&emsp;It’s a complicated thing for a designer to be responsible for the last show of a 
                    fashion week: There’s an expectation, illogical though it may be, that the event may 
                    somehow sum up all the others; put a nice, neat bow on top. This is compounded when the 
                    show is the last show of the whole four-city season, and it’s even more fraught when the 
                    season we are talking about is the first season of the next 10 years.<br/><br/>

                    On the other hand, that designer also gets the last word.<br/><br/>
                    
                    So what was Nicolas Ghesquière, artistic director of Louis Vuitton women’s wear, saying 
                    Tuesday night as a dark courtyard of the Louvre was illuminated by hundreds of smartphone 
                    lights from the crowd waiting just outside the barricades (clamoring for a glimpse of 
                    Alicia Vikander, Ruth Negga, Catherine Deneuve) and the spring 2020 ready-to-wear marathon 
                    me to an end?<br/><br/>

                    
                    Mr. Ghesquière had built a giant, plain plywood box (from sustainably sourced wood, 
                    of course, all to be recycled) inside the Cour Carrée. On one wall of the box was a 
                    giant screen and on it, a video of a woman’s head, neck and shoulders, set against a 
                    lightening sky was playing. Her eyes were closed, as in repose. The sun rose behind her, 
                    and gradually they widened. Then she opened her lipsticked mouth and began to sing, and a 
                    door in the base of her throat (well, not literally: it was in the wall) opened, too. Out 
                    a model emerged, like Athena from her father Zeus’s head — but not exactly. The tune, by 
                    Sophie Xeon (known professionally as SOPHIE), the Scottish video and music producer and 
                    artist, was “It’s O.K. to Cry.”<br/><br>
                    Also some old ones. Mr. Ghesquière was at romp in the fields of fashion, mixing up Belle 
                    Époque prints — swirling curlicues and Art Nouveau portraits; fecund florals; thoughts of 
                    Sarah Bernhardt and Marcel Proust — with rainbow sequin zigzag knits and lacy embroidered 
                    tulle. The silhouettes had a contemporary motility (thank goodness, no panniers) though 
                    there were some puffed sleeves. Also skater skirts and tulip skirts; flared, cropped 
                    trousers; neat jackets, and bibbed dresses. Waists were small and the dominant shape was 
                    an angular hourglass. On every look, a curling cattleya orchid was pinned.<br/><br/>

                    In an interview before the show, Mr. Ghesquière talked about how “today’s world can create anxiety; 
                    a fear of ‘what’s going to happen,’” and the desire to “not make things too new. We don’t 
                    always have to be scared of retro,” he continued. “We grow from what we learn.”</p>

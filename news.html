                <a href="news1.html"><p>&emsp;A program that monitors teachers’ “praise rates” led to improved 
                    student behavior and achievement in a well-designed evaluation. Praising students for good behavior 
                    is central to many strategies for helping teachers deal with unruly students. Scolding students 
                    isn’t. But does this nice-guy approach really work with kids who are testing boundaries, 
                    especially rambunctious adolescents? One widely used program called CHAMPS was recently 
                    tested in a study involving more than 100 teachers and almost 1,500 middle-school students 
                    in a randomized controlled trial — the kind of gold-standard experiment that is common 
                    in medicine but not in education. The experiment took place in two St. Louis school 
                    districts with a majority of Black and low-income students.

                <a href="news3.html"><p>&emsp;It’s a complicated thing for a designer to be responsible for the last 
                    show of a fashion week: There’s an expectation, illogical though it may be, that the event may 
                    somehow sum up all the others; put a nice, neat bow on top. So what was Nicolas Ghesquière, 
                    artistic director of Louis Vuitton women’s wear, saying Tuesday night as a dark courtyard of 
                    the Louvre was illuminated by hundreds of smartphone lights from the crowd waiting just outside 
                    the barricades (clamoring for a glimpse of Alicia Vikander, Ruth Negga, Catherine Deneuve) and the 
                    spring 2020 ready-to-wear marathon me to an end?

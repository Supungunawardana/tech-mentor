                other designers and how new modes of thinking and inspiration are integral to the design process. Finally, you’ll examine the future of fashion

            <h1>About the Transforming the Fashion Business Specialization</h1>
            <p>&emsp;In this specialization, you will analyze the fashion business and how it must evolve into a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable manifestation

                sustainable future. You’ll look at the design process from the perspective of analytical and statistical trend forecasting and how to bring new 
                strategies and technologies into your design approach, all while maintaining an awareness of social movements and cultural shifts. And finally, 
                you’ll learn how fashion retail can create memorable, immersive, and innovative experiences that help you and your brand stay relevant in an age 
                of increasing competition and shifting consumer models.<br/><br/>

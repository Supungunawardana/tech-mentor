            <h1>About this Course</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Design is the first phase in the digital manufacturing process. In this course, through a series of lectures and 
                hands-on lessons, we’ll examine a designer’s approach to the design and manufacturing process—from concept to 3D model. 
                We’ll start by applying design thinking to understand user needs, and then we’ll explore design criteria as we dive deeper 
                into Autodesk® Fusion 360™ sketching, modeling, rendering, and documentation features.<br/><br/>
                &emsp; There have many three-dimensional shape of the object in your brain that are wanted to share, but do not know how 
                to express? How to "sketch" the three-dimensional image in your mind? 3D modeling technology can help us construct the most 
                intuitive and understandable three-dimensional model. The use of floor plan interpret the three-dimensional object process－the 
                most direct and effective expression of our ideas. We have designed many paradigms so that people can quickly understand 
                the logic of using 3D CAD software Sketchup and drawing skills, from introduction to advanced, and introduce SketchUp 3D 
                modeling technologies. After completing "3D CAD Fundamental", it is no longer difficult to draw ideas that are beyond 
                imagination with 3D modeling technology! The goal of this course is to construct a three-dimensional model, with the 
                computer as the main teaching material, to enrich the fun paradigm and the complete drawing process. Step-by-step teach 
                you how to use Sketchup's 3D modeling software technology. With the completion of "3D CAD Fundamental", you will be able 
                to realize the 3D objects that exist in the imagination through 3D modeling!
